In this we are having the dataset of flipkart customers, in which we have applied some techniques to get better output.
We have done the following processes:

1. **Data Cleaning and Pre- processes:**
We have done the pre-processing and cleaning of dataset as per our requirement

2. **Visualization of data:**
We have done the visualization on data also and draw some graphs of the given data
  A. Product Category v/s Number of Product
  
  B. Product Category v/s Mean Discount Percentage

3.**Measuring the accuracy of the model:**
Here, in this we have used the Naive bayes algorithm (only taken top 5 category) to do the analysis.


4.**Improvement in the accuracy of model and other algorithms which we can try:**
We can also use the Cosine Similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two products or we can als apply other machine learning algorithm to get the required output. We can also improve accuracy of model by removing the null values from the dataset.


Here, in this we have removed the following column from the dataset.As, we donâ€™t need them. (product_url,image,is_FK_Advantage_product)
